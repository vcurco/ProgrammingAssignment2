# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix

# The operators <<- and ->> are normally only used in functions, and cause a search to made through parent environments
# for an existing definition of the variable being assigned. If such a variable is found (and its binding is not locked) # then its value is redefined, otherwise assignment takes place in the global environment.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set=set, get=get, setinverse=setinverse, getinverse=getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

# The following function returns the inverse of the matrix. It first checks if
# the inverse has already been computed. If so, it gets the result and skips the
# computation. If not, it computes the inverse, sets the value in the cache via
# setinverse function.

## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
# This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.
# Use the generic function solve for the equation ax = b for x, where b can be either a vector or a matrix.

  inv <- solve(data)
